Step 1: Understanding and Preparing the Data
Load the dataset and conduct an exploratory analysis, understanding the distribution and relationship between variables.
Visualize the data through different plots to understand trends, patterns, and potential outliers or anomalies.
Prepare the data for modeling, handling missing values appropriately, and possibly creating variable categories if needed.

Step 2: Building the Initial Poisson Regression Model
Construct a Poisson regression model with all relevant predictors, considering the nature of the response variable (count data).
Analyze the model summary to identify significant variables and understand the model's initial performance.

Step 3: Refining the Model - Selection Criteria and Diagnostics
Perform stepwise regression procedures using criteria like AIC and BIC for model selection:
AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) is used for model selection, with a preference for lower values indicating a better model fit relative to others. It's beneficial in scenarios where prediction accuracy is paramount, even at the expense of simplicity.
BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) also aims for lower values, favoring simpler models compared to AIC, especially in cases of overfitting. It is more conservative than AIC.
If there's a discrepancy between AIC and BIC selections, conduct a likelihood ratio test to decide on the more appropriate model. A lower p-value (typically below 0.05) suggests rejecting the simpler model for the one with more predictors.


Step 4: Diagnostics and Influential Observations
Check residual plots to identify any deviations from randomness, indicating model inadequacies.
Investigate potential overdispersion (mean differing significantly from variance), considering quasi-Poisson or negative binomial models if present.
Analyze leverage points and influential observations using metrics like Cook's distance. High values indicate observations that are unduly influencing the model's performance.

Step 5: Model Interpretation and Predictions
Interpret the final model coefficients in terms of rate ratios, explaining the practical significance of these figures.
Discuss the model's predictive capabilities, considering its application in practical scenarios.

Step 6: Conclusions and Recommendations
Summarize the analysis findings, highlighting the key predictors and their impact on the response variable.
Acknowledge the study's limitations, suggesting areas for future research or alternative methods for consideration.
Provide clear, evidence-based recommendations following the analysis results.

Step 7: Appendix
Compile all relevant tables, figures, and code scripts used throughout the analysis for reference and reproducibility.
