Step 1: Data Summary
-- Load the meta-analysis dataset and display the initial studies included to understand the scope of data you're working with.
-- Provide descriptive statistics for key metrics across studies, such as effect sizes, confidence intervals, and sample sizes.
-- Visualize the data to identify patterns, outliers, or inconsistencies: Construct forest plots to visualize the individual effect sizes and confidence intervals from each study.
    Create funnel plots to assess the presence of publication bias.
-- Address any missing or incomplete data points in your dataset, deciding whether to impute them or exclude the study from the analysis.

Step 2: Diagnostics

-- Assess the assumptions underlying your meta-analysis:
    Heterogeneity: Examine whether the studies' results are compatible using statistical measures like the IÂ² statistic or Cochran's Q test.
    Publication bias: Evaluate potential publication bias using tests like Egger's test or visual assessment of funnel plots.
-- Decide on remedies if assumptions are violated:
    Consider a random-effects model if there's significant heterogeneity.
    Explore methods like trim-and-fill if publication bias is suspected.

Step 3: Model Fitting
-- Choose and apply the appropriate meta-analysis model (fixed-effect or random-effects) based on your diagnostic assessments.
-- Calculate the overall effect size and its confidence interval to synthesize the results of the included studies.
-- Perform subgroup analyses or meta-regression, if applicable, to explore sources of heterogeneity.

Step 4: Analysis
-- Interpret the results of your meta-analysis, paying attention to the direction and magnitude of the overall effect size.
-- If heterogeneity is present, discuss its implications and how it might influence the interpretation of your results.
-- Visualize your findings with comprehensive plots, ensuring they effectively communicate the results and implications.
