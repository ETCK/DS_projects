### Step 1: Summary of Data
**-- Exploratory Analysis**: Load and explore the dataset containing data from two groups (e.g., Group A and Group B) to identify preliminary trends and relationships.

**-- Data Visualization**: Visualize various aspects of the data to uncover patterns, anomalies, or outliers within each group.

**-- Missing Data Analysis**: Address any missing values and prepare the data for t-test analysis, ensuring it meets the requirements for a robust t-test.

---

### Step 2:  Formulate Hypotheses
**-- Hypothesis Definition**:Define your null hypothesis (H0) and alternative hypothesis (Ha) specific to your t-test analysis: H0: There is no significant difference between the means of Group A and Group B. H1: There is a significant difference between the means of Group A and Group B.

### Step 3: Perform the T-Test
**-- T-Test Selection**: Choose the appropriate type of t-test (e.g., independent samples t-test) based on your data and assumptions.

**-- Calculations**: Compute the t-statistic and degrees of freedom. Determine the critical t-value from the t-distribution (e.g., Î± = 0.05).Calculate the p-value for the t-statistic.

**-- Test Selection**: Choose the chi-square test that aligns with your data and assumptions (e.g., test of independence).

**-- Calculations**: Determine the chi-square statistic, degrees of freedom, and the p-value. (This will be executed through coding.)

---

### Step 4: Decision and Interpretation
**-- Critical Value Comparison**:  Compare your calculated t-statistic with the critical t-value.

**-- P-Value Interpretation**: If p < alpha (commonly 0.05), reject H0.

**-- Findings**: Provide an interpretation based on the statistical outcome, detailing the association (or lack thereof) between the variables. (This interpretation will be done through coding.)

---

### Step 5: Conclusion and Recommendations
**-- Summary**: Summarize the key findings from the t-test analysis.

**--  Practical Implications**: Discuss the real-world relevance of any differences observed between the groups.

**-- Evidence-Based Insights**: Offer recommendations or insights based on the t-test outcomes.

### Step 6: Add Appendix
Present all tables, figures, and statistical outputs generated during the analysis. Also, include the code used for the analysis, whether it was done in R, Python, SPSS, or any other statistical software.
