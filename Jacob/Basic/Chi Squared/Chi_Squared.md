### Step 1: Summary of Data
**-- Exploratory Analysis**: Load the dataset and perform an initial analysis to understand the variable distributions and relationships.

**-- Data Visualization**: Use various plots to detect trends, patterns, and potential outliers or anomalies.

**-- Missing Data Analysis**: Prepare the data for modeling by addressing missing values and potentially creating variable categories.

---

### Step 2:  Formulate Hypotheses
**-- Hypothesis Definition**: Clearly state your null hypothesis (H0) and alternative hypothesis (Ha) concerning the association between categorical variables.H0: No association exists (independence).H1: An association is present.

---

### Step 3: Perform the Chi-Square Test
**-- Contingency Table**: Construct this table from your data, detailing the frequencies.

**-- Expected Frequencies**: Calculate these for each cell of the table.

**-- Test Selection**: Choose the chi-square test that aligns with your data and assumptions (e.g., test of independence).

**-- Calculations**: Determine the chi-square statistic, degrees of freedom, and the p-value. (This will be executed through coding.)

---

### Step 4: Decision and Interpretation
**-- Critical Value Comparison**: Compare your calculated chi-square statistic to the critical value from chi-square distribution tables.

**-- P-Value Interpretation**: If p < alpha (commonly 0.05), reject H0.

**-- Findings**: Provide an interpretation based on the statistical outcome, detailing the association (or lack thereof) between the variables. (This interpretation will be done through coding.)

---

### Step 5: Conclusion and Recommendations
**-- Summary**: Concisely recap the key outcomes of your chi-square analysis.

**--  Practical Implications**: Discuss the real-world significance of any association found between the categories.

**-- Evidence-Based Insights**: Offer recommendations or predictions based on the chi-square results, touching on causal relationships or future implications. (This part will be executed through coding.)

### Step 6: Add Appendix
Present all tables, figures, and statistical outputs generated during the analysis. Also, include the code used for the analysis, whether it was done in R, Python, SPSS, or any other statistical software.
